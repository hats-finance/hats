We chose the crow as the main character of the collection because in many ways crows hold the same values as Hats Finance. \n\n The crow is an animal associated with mysteries and magic, often in a negative connotation. However, they also serve an important role in the ecosystem, helping the world get rid of bacteria and restore the forests. The same can be said about Hackers, who are often seen as negative characters, yet they are essential in the crypto ecosystem. \n\n Like our early supporters, crows are clever, intelligent, adaptable, with excellent teamwork and reciprocity - exactly what we see in the Hat's community.",
