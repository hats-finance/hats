However, they also serve an important role in the ecosystem, helping the world get rid of bacteria and restore the forests. The same can be said about Hackers, who are often seen as negative characters, yet they are essential in the crypto ecosystem. \n\n Like our early supporters, crows are clever, intelligent, adaptable, with excellent teamwork and reciprocity - exactly what we see in the Hat's community.",
